    "paragraph1": "In its original Latin as “the pierced”, the term punctum refers to a “small spot”, a “very small spot, speck or puncture” in the image. Thus, unlike the studium, the punctum is not based on a general or “polite interest” in a photograph, but pierces it as an “arrow” and leaves a “wound” at the incision site.",
    "paragraph2": "Information contained in the photograph becomes visible as part of the „studium“ and makes its way into consciousness in the course of cultural perception. In contrast, the punctum forms an unconscious puncture, it breaks affectively into the viewer's world and pushes any informational references into the background. What remains at the place of incision is a bewilderment, an emotion or a longing.",
