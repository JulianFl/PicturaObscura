    "paragraph1": "Originally laid out in Latin as 'the pricked', the term punctum denotes a 'small spot', a 'very small spot, dot, or prick' in the picture. Thus, the punctum does not, like the studium, base itself on the general or 'polite interest' in a photo, but pierces it as an 'arrow' and leaves a 'wound' at the interface.",
    "paragraph2": "Information applied in photography becomes visible as part of the studium and paves its way into consciousness in the course of cultural perception. In contrast, the punctum forms an unconscious sting, it breaks affectively into the viewer's world and pushes any informational references into the background. What remains at the point of the prick is an affectation, an emotion or a longing.",
